'''[http://www.visitaarhus.com/ Aarhus]''' (also written \'c5rhus and pronounced Oar-Hoos) is the main city on the [[Jutland]] peninsula in [[Denmark]]. With a population of just over 300,000 people (1,200,000 in the East Jutland metropolitan area), it holds the titles of Denmark's second largest city and the city with the youngest population. \
\
==Understand==\
Aarhus offers an elegant mix of cosmopolitan city and quaint small-town charm, with wonderful pubs, restaurants and romantic places. Being a university city and centre for education, Aarhus has a large student population and the average age of its inhabitants is among the lowest in Europe.\
\
Some interesting facts:\
* Aarhus hosts the largest cultural festival in Scandinavia, known as "[http://www.aarhusfestuge.dk/aarhusfestuge/festuge.nsf/links/English Aarhus Festuge]" (Aarhus Festival). It is held every year for 10 days in August-September.\
* Aarhus is part of the East Jutland Metropolitan area, which by far has the fastest growing population in Denmark.\
* Aarhus has for many years been known as a nesting box for Danish musicians and bands, primarily in main stream pop and rock music.\
* Aarhus is known as ''The City of Smiles'' (da. ''Smilets By''). It probably just started as a slogan to improve the city's image, but it has nevertheless caught on, and has for many years been a common nickname for the city.\
* Aarhus is also known as ''The City of Caf\'e9s'' - visit the city and you will soon know why.\
* There has been a veritable building boom in Aarhus in recent years, with many large scale projects. Several are already finished, but many are still being planned, including some tall highrises.\
* The '''Tourist Information Office''' has been closed and replaced with a few information screens across the city.\
\
==Talk==\
Many Danes are often reserved towards strangers, but friendly towards tourists, and will normally be happy to give you directions and advice in good English. As Aarhus is a big city, it will hardly be a problem getting help or directions in near-fluent English.\
\
==Get in==\
\
===By train===\
[[File:\'c5rhus station 2011 2.jpg|thumb|Arriving at the Aarhus Central Station.]]\
Trains run once or twice an hour from Copenhagen (K\'f8benhavn) to Aarhus and take about three hours. As of July 2015, the adult fare is DKK382, with an additional DKK30 to reserve a seat. Discounts are available for persons 25 years old or younger (if buying a ''WildCard''), or older than 65 years\'97both concessions cost DKK191 (half price). Discounts can also be obtained by buying ''Orange Tickets'' some weeks in advance. Details on '''[http://www.dsb.dk DSB]''''s homepage.\
\
It is also possible to catch a train to any other part of the Jutland peninsula, though connections are usually bad. Trains from [[Hamburg]] arrive several times a day, but they are expensive (around \'8050 one way). Nevertheless, if you book about two months before travelling, you can buy one of the few tickets for \'8029/39 (called "Europa-Sparpreis"). For more information check out the website of the German national railway company '''[http://www.db.de DB]'''\
\
Tickets used in trains are also usable in buses, and if you are travelling from Copenhagen, you can use your ticket for the rest of the day to get around Aarhus at no extra expense.\
\
===By bus===\
Buses have become an increasingly attractive way of travelling between Aarhus and Copenhagen due to their significantly lower prices. An inter-city bus takes roughly an hour longer than an equivalent express train, but the fares are typically between 40% (standard tickets) and 90% (the cheapest Saver tickets) lower.\

===By foot===\
The entire city is clean and well organized which makes '''walking''' an excellent and enjoyable way to get around. You can pick up a leaflet called "Aarhus - five historical walks". The walks are all short and you could do them all easily in a day as they are all in the city centre. If you want to venture further out, several routes have been established for both exercise and leisurely strolls. Known as "[http://www.naturhistoriskmuseum.dk/Files/Filer/Solstraaler/a5-folder-UK.pdf sunbeams]", they avoid heavily trafficked roads and includes nature experiences. \
\
===By bicycle===\
Rent a bike in [http://www.bikes4rent.dk/ Bikes4Rent] or better yet, '''borrow a free [http://www.aarhus.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/AarhusBycykel/Home/English.aspx?sc_lang=da City Bike]''', available at around fifty spots around the city (check the link to see a map). You just need to insert a DKK 20 coin and when you park the bike at another "bike station", you get it back. If you choose to bike after dark, remember to bring your own bicycle lights; it is illegal to ride without them and you could get fined by the police if you forget. The City Bikes are available from 1 April to 20 October.\
\
===By bus===\
Bus tickets for travel within the city limits ([http://www.midttrafik.dk/priser+og+billetter/priser/Aarhus+kommune Aarhus Kommune] limits) are DKK20 - or DKK10 if you are under 16 years of age. Tickets are also available in 10-trip tickets, that vary in price depending on how far you want to go (DKK120-220). Cheaper cards are also available for people under 16 year olds. Finally there are tickets that allow you to ride all you want for 30 days, with prices vary depending on how far you wish to travel. For planning bus trips, it is recommended to use the official travelplanner website for all Danish public transport: [http://www.rejseplanen.dk/ Rejseplanen].\
\
You can also buy a cheap '''[http://www.visitaarhus.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/om-aarhus/sightseeing/aarhuspas/produktside.htm?id=16515& Aarhus Pass]''' which covers all bus transport and all the museums.\

Anyone who appreciates European architecture will find many points of interest in the city, not least the '''Concert Hall''' ("Musikhuset" from 1982 by Johan Richter), located next to the new modern arts museum ARoS. Many attractions in Aarhus are free and the public space has many free facilities, events and an interesting street life, so even on a budget you can have an enjoyable experience. \

| content=This building is considered one of the highlights of Danish architecture, designed by the famous architects Arne Jacobsen and Erik M\'f8ller in cooperation with equally celebrated furniture designer Hans Wegner. Clad in grey Norwegian marble, it might appear bland to the untrained eye from the outside, but the indoor design is much more intriguing. Every Saturday from 10 to 11:30 guided tours are arranged around the interior of the building. For a fee, you can visit the clock tower and enjoy the view. There are several interesting statues around the town hall. Enjoy the dramatic bronze statue and fountain of "Agnethe og Havmanden" near the city entrance towards the Central Station. It depicts a scene from a Danish fairy tale about Agnethe who falls in love with a merman. From here you can walk through the city entrance and the Town Hall Park and observe more bronze statues and memorial stones. The park is quite lively in the summer, as people tend to flock here as soon as the Sun is out. Don't miss the Grisebr\'f8nden statue (the well of the pigs) with the drooling and peeing pigs, at the Town Hall Square in front of the town hall main entrance. You can find good hotdogs at the Town Hall Square too.\

=== Watersports ===\
If you are in Aarhus in the summer, there are good opportunities for outdoor watersports and most of the coastline of the bay is accessible and suitable for leisure activities. Most beaches are sandy and child friendly with shallow waters. With two marinas in the central harbour and with many marinas spread across the entire bay area, some tourists choose to visit Aarhus from the waterside in the summer, in their own ship.\
\
[[File:RisskovStrand.jpg|thumb|There are several beach parks in Aarhus. The whole Bay of Aarhus is popular with activities in the summer.]]\
There are [http://www.arrangoeriaarhus.dk/da/Vaelg-sted/Strande-og-naturomraader.aspx four beaches] worthy of special mention: The beach park of '''\'c5krogen''' in Eg\'e5 north of the city, '''Bellevue Beach Park''' in the city district of Risskov, the sea bath of '''Den Permanente''' below the forest of Riis Skov in the city centre and the beach park of '''Moesg\'e5rd Strand''' in the south of the Marselisborg Forests. There are several other small spots inbetween. Be aware that, every time the cat-link catamaran ferries enter and leave the bay, they cause an increased wave activity in the entire bay area. The phenomenon is harmless, but some small children are frightened by the experience, especially when it happens on an otherwise calm day. The waves appear quite suddenly; they only become noticeable when they break at the shoreline (like mini-tsunamis), lasting for 5-10 minutes. In theory you could predict it by watching for the catamarans on the water, glance at their schedule or be attentive to the increasing waves. Or you might simply choose not to care, as most people.\
\
There are a total of [http://www.vigirbyenpuls.dk/da/Svoemmehaller.aspx four public indoor swimming halls] throughout the city that can be used most of the year. Be sure to check up, as some are closed for extensive periods in the summer. Same prize at all venues, with discounts for children and groups. You can rent towels and bathing suits at some places, but it is expensive.

The '''pedestrian zone''' in the city centre is the best place for shopping. You cannot miss it, as you will step right into it, when leaving the Aarhus central station or arriving at the central bus terminal. It is packed with small speciality boutiques and caf\'e9s, but also larger stores like the three '''H&M''' apparel stores and the department stores of '''Salling''' and '''Magasin du Nord''' and several supermarkets. Especially the main street known as '''Str\'f8get''', highlights upscale Scandinavian clothing, design and jewellery shops. There are a number of larger bookstores here where you can buy books in English too, including guides and maps.\

| content=The Latin Quater (so called by the locals) is a central shopping district in the old city centre. The quarter is situated next to the Cathedral, confined by ''Mejlgade'', ''N\'f8rregade'' and the church of ''Vor Frue Kirke'' to be precise. Here you will find small 'independent' shops and some of the city's oldest caf\'e9s. Several unique fashion boutiques with design, clothes and furniture, some with exclusive Danish design such as the '''[http://beoaarhus.dk/ Bang & Olufsen]''' Hi-Fi store. Small art galleries, vinyl record stores, tatoo and haircut saloons, all in a diverse mix. Try a piece of luxurious chocolate or outstanding marzipan at the small '''[https://summerbird.dk/736/sb--%C3%85rhus--volden Summerbird]''' store, grab a coffee or a bite to eat at one of the caf\'e9s or restaurants, go to a small initimate concert at Gyngen or just wander about soaking up the atmosphere and street life. If you're in the city in mid-September, your trip may coincide with ''Mejlgade for Mangfoldighed'', a 1-day street party in Mejlgade. Every year in May or September, the shops and businesses of the whole neighbourhood also celebrate ''Latinerfestival'' for a couple of days, with engaging street events and small concerts.\

==Eat==\
There are hundreds of restaurants in Aarhus, reaching from cheap kebab joints, to high-class dining. Aarhus is generally known as one of the best places to eat in Denmark, probably due to the large amount of conferences, good quality food products from local producers, major educational institutions for cooking and food production, and strong competition. However, the best places are not necessarily located on the most prominent addresses, so a bit of browsing is recommended if you have a particular interest in fine dining. Also, be aware that many restaurants are closed for extensive periods throughout the year. Usually in the summer months or January-February, so be sure to check up, if you plan to visit a specific place.\
\
The main shopping streets of J\'e6gerg\'e5rdsgade, Str\'f8get, \'c5boulevarden (aka '''\'c5en''', along the Aarhus River), Vestergade and Tordenskjoldsgade has many options for a meal of all kinds. The Latin Quarter is also packed with restaurants and caf\'e9s serving food. \
\
With an immigrant population of around 15%, Aarhus has many opportunities for ethnic food. This includes Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese food as the most common options. The price range are from Budget to Mid-range and you can find good ethnic food at street vendors to fine restaurants.\
\
The locals regularly frequent the many caf\'e9s of the city while out and about. Besides being the best option for breakfast (around DKK 45), brunch and lunch, many larger caf\'e9s serve excellent home made burgers, salads, sandwiches, soups and snacks at reasonable prices (DKK 80-150 for a meal).\
\
===Budget===\
As Aarhus is a city full of students, there are many budget priced places, but they can be hard to spot for the hurried tourist and a little research (or asking) is a a good idea. You do not have to compromise on quality in Aarhus, even when eating on a budget. Many mid-ranged places usually have a few budget options: it can be a cheap good quality lunch, student discounts or special discount nights.\

Most places also sell red coloured boiled sausages, a Danish specialty. They are funny to look at, but some of the other sausages for sale are more flavourful. The inner city has several ''P\'f8lsevogn'', there is one in front of the central station and another at the City Hall Square.

Usually special dinner plans around the feasts such as ''Mortens Aften'' (St. Martin's Day 11 November), Christmas and Easter. Prices are mostly mid range.\

\
=== Caf\'e9s ===\
[[File:Caf\'e9 Casablanca.jpg|thumb|Caf\'e9 Casablanca is one of the more prominent caf\'e9s in Aarhus.]]\
The many caf\'e9s in Aarhus span a diverse range from tiny hole-in-the-walls with two chairs where you can stop and buy something to drink on your way through the city to extravagantly decorated places with mirror rooms and waiters in fancy clothes. Some places serve only the most basic items, while other places offer lunch, evening dinners or cocktails and parties in the night. So whatever you are looking for, it shouldn't be a problem to find a caf\'e9 that suits your taste or pocket. \
\
Quite a few caf\'e9s have a strong focus on quality coffee. [http://www.altura.dk/ Altura], [http://www.lacabra.dk/ La Cabra], [http://www.greatcoffee.dk/ Great Coffee] and [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bills-Coffee/379996775461386 Bill's Coffee] are four exceptional places in this regard, but they get strong competition. The coffee shop chain of [http://streetcoffee.dk/ Street Coffee] is also doing a pretty good job and you can find them at three spots in the inner city. If you do not enjoy coffee, most places also serve hot chocolate or tea, but quality tea is only beginning to catch on and you might want to visit [http://perchs.dk/ A.C.Perch] for the real deal. It is a sister to the celebrated and historic tea store and caf\'e9 in Copenhagen by the same name and you will not be dissappointed. Many caf\'e9s can make you a smoothie, and [http://juicestop.dk/ Juice Stop] and [https://www.joejuice.com/ Joe & The Juice] specialize in juicing fresh fruits and vegetables.\
\
The majority of caf\'e9s in Aarhus are unique, each with their own individual charm and character, but several Danish caf\'e9 chains are also present, including Baresso, Emmerys and Anettes Sandwich, and you can find them across the city. [http://baresso.com/ Baresso] mostly focus on quality coffee, but also serves cakes, small meals and tea. With usual spacious rooms and comfortable furniture, they are a good place to sit and chat for a while or rest your legs and read a magazine. If you want something to eat, [http://www.anettessandwich.dk/ Anettes Sandwich] is a better option. [http://www.emmerys.dk/ Emmerys] is a chain of organic bakeries, but each store is also a dining caf\'e9 and here you can get breakfast and brunch too. \
\
Breakfast (''morgenmad'' in Danish) is served at most larger caf\'e9s for reasonable prices (DKK 35-80). At some spots it is buffet-style with a good variety, while at other spots it consists of a bun with cheese and jam. The bread is always of a good, filling quality. Some larger caf\'e9s also serve brunch and it is a popular treat on the weekends especially. A few places regularly arrange luxurious brunch servings, sometimes including champagne, like the [http://www.varna.dk/ Varna Palace] in the Marselisborg Forests. Lunch of various kinds, prices and qualities can also be had at many caf\'e9s and there are quite a few deli-shops with healthy fast food options such as salads and sandwiches. Dining caf\'e9s with evening meals are plentiful at the riverside, but also in the Latin Quarter, including [https://www.facebook.com/cafegemmestedet Gemmestedet], [http://www.cafe-englen.dk/ Englen], [http://drudenfuss.dk/ Drudenfuss], [http://www.carlton.dk/ Carlton] and [http://www.casablancaaarhus.dk/cafe-casablanca/ Casablanca]. The shopping streets of J\'e6gerg\'e5rdsgade on Frederiksbjerg and Tordenskjoldsgade on Tr\'f8jborg also have several good ones. \
\
Although there is a high concentration in the inner city, caf\'e9s can be found throughout. A few special places might be hard to discover without special mention:\
\

| content=LYNfabrikken (The Lightning Factory) is an alternative office community for small creative businesses, and it also includes a caf\'e9. Located in an old factory building in a backyard in Vestergade, it has a special aura of old and new and it can be an inspirational visit to have a peek at what is stirring in the creative entrepreneurial milieu of Aarhus. The caf\'e9 is located in the loft of the factory, equipped with a rooftop terrace. A good place to be in the summer for a quick change of scenery and a laid back secludedness in the midst of the bustling central city. The caf\'e9 offers beverages (good coffee), cakes and a small choice of food. It is spacious, well-lit and you can sit here to write, read, chat, relax or glance at books and crafts for sale. LYNfabrikken can be hard to spot, so you might have to investigate a few backyards in the vicinity before you locate it. This is not a bad thing, as you will surely make other interesting discoveries. There is a small exhibition room at the street near the backyard with changing arts and crafts.\

There used to be a great caf\'e9 and vinyl store in Klostergade for many years, but it closed in 2015. Other places selling vinyl record includes Badstuerock and Dandelion Records, both in the Latin Quarter, Route 66 & Black Light Records in Fredensgade and Pladekisten in J\'e6gerg\'e5rdsgade.\
\}\}\
\
=== Cakes and bread ===\
Denmark has a long tradition for some unique cakes and good quality breadmaking. You can buy cakes and bread in the usual caf\'e9s or in common bakeries across the city, but some places has put a special effort into the craft of baking and is well worth a visit. \

It is a chain of bakeries with shops in Aarhus and Copenhagen, but it originated in Aarhus in 1918 as a p\'e2tisserie (known as ''Konditori'' in Danish) in Guldsmedgade. There are six Emmerys in Aarhus, with four in the central parts. They all have a nice clean but cosy decor with seatings for dining and some small-talking. Good breakfast and brunch with a good selection of cakes and breads, but also high-end foodstuff like coffee, tea, pickles, marmalade, etc. The opening hours as well as the food for sale vary a little bit from shop to shop, but all are open every day of the week.\

The name ''Sm\'e5kagehuset'' means "The Cookie House" and their broad and changing selection of cakes also includes cookies. Denmark has a long tradition for some unique cookies and is well-known for its export of butter cookies. At Sm\'e5kagehuset you can pick and choose you own mix of Danish cookies, including ''vanillekranse'', ''j\'f8dekager'' and ''finsk br\'f8d'' but also other types, like the Italian-style biscotti. If you have a hard time choosing, just take your time or simply ask the bakers themselves about their baked goods, as they also works as sales clerks and are happy to chat and explain. As a specialty you can also buy sugar-free cakes here and baked goods certified for consumption by diabetics. There are a few chairs inside and a bench outside on the pavements.\
\}\}\
\
The traditional bread in Denmark is ''Rugbr\'f8d'', a special kind of dark and dense sourdough, wholemeal rye bread, and it is still a popular choice, especially for ''sm\'f8rrebr\'f8d''. Common white bread, locally known as ''franskbr\'f8d'' (French Bread), is equally popular and available everywhere. \
 \
Special cakes are made around Christmas and Carnival. Special Christmas cakes includes ''julekage'' (a large Danish pastry with marzipan, Corinthian raisins, succade and nuts), ''pebern\'f8dder'' (small peppery cookies, traditionally used for a number of games) and ''klejner'' (deep fried rhombus shaped dough, flavoured with cardamom and lemon zest and only slightly sweet) and for Carnival in February it includes a variety of ''fastelavnsboller'' (Carnival-buns), which usually comprise pastry creme filled buns with icing and flaky pastry cakes filled with a whipped cream mix and redcurrant jelly.\
\
==Drink==\
Aarhus has a robust and lively nightlife for those who are looking for a night on the town. The city can deliver everything from big mainstream clubs to small alternative hangouts playing niche music. Aarhus's large student population fuels a major part of the partying - which tends to keep prices reasonable -, but not exclusively. Prices for food and drink are generally higher than in other parts of Europe, but cheaper than Copenhagen and with several budget options. The action tends to concentrate around J\'e6gerg\'e5rdsgade, Frederiksgade, \'c5boulevarden, Vestergade, Latin Quarter, Mejlgade and N\'f8rregade. The popular fashionable riverside (''\'c5en'' in Danish) has a very lively nightlife with a good variety, but it is also the most expensive area.\
\
The nightlife in Denmark and Aarhus is quite safe. As a side note, the nightlife in Aarhus has, in the last 25-30 years, occasionally been plagued with gangs of young immigrants, primarily of Middle Eastern descent harassing people, smashing windows and bars or selling drugs. These incidents might be rarer these days, but if you are a group of young males with a Middle Eastern look, be aware that you could risk being denied access to some of the more popular spots. Young immigrants in Aarhus have raised this situation as a matter of concern.\
\
The most widely available Danish beers are Tuborg, Carlsberg and Ceres. With a 150 year old history in Aarhus, Ceres was by many considered the "beer of Aarhus", with Ceres TOP as the flagship pilsner, but the beer is not brewed locally anymore. Most places also serve other well-known international brands and most places serve them draft. A few spots, like '''Ris Ras''' and '''Cockney Pub''', has specialized in quality beers in the recent decade or so and offers a large variety for the beer-connoisseur. '''[http://aarhusbryghus.dk/homepage/english/ Aarhus Brewery]''' in Viby is a local micro-brewery worth investigating. They make a good variety and is on sale in most well-assorted shops and some pubs and bars as well. There is also a small shop at the brewery and occasional events and beer tastings are arranged here. '''[http://bryggeriet.dk/eng/breweries/sct-clemens-aarhus Sct. Clements Brewery]''' across the main theatre also brews quality draft beer, to be enjoyed at their Hereford restaurant or brought home.\

In Denmark, ''bodega'' means a traditional Danish bar or Danish pub if you will. Bodegas has a long cultural history in Denmark and is somewhat similar to an English pub in their concept, but only a few places offers meals and live music. You could warm up here before going to a concert or a fancy club or you can drop in for a coffee or a beer in the afternoon. It should be fairly easy to find yourself engaged in a conversation at these places if you care, as the majority of people are here to socialize and unwind. Some examples includes\uc0\u720 \

In the older days, when alcohol was seen as a basic thirst quencher for the working man, bars were much more abundant. They were waterholes with the sole purpose of serving cheap beers on all hours and all days of the week. Times have changed, but there are still some old fashioned bars left in Aarhus, some of them with their own peculiar charm. The Danish word for these bars are ''v\'e6rtshus''. Apart from the colloquial Ceres TOP pilsner, most places could also serve you an "Aarhus set", by adding an Arnbitter on the side.\

If you need to use a computer, you can use one of many freely available stationary computers at Dokk1 library on the harbour front. They use the Ubuntu Linux operating system and you can also go online through an sms-authentification system.\
\
== Cope ==\
\
=== Accessibility ===\
In Denmark, it is easy for the physically disabled to get around on their own. All newer buildings - and quite a few older ones as well - are specially equipped for this, with ramps, elevators, lifts and sometimes escalators. With a thought for the visually impaired, the traffic lights at the busiest spots in Aarhus are equipped with beeping sounds, signalling walk or stop. Guide dogs are allowed in most places, even in some cinemas, and personnel are unusually friendly and helpful towards the handicapped. \
\
=== Poverty and begging ===\
Before the turn of the century, it was extremely rare to see anyone in Denmark begging in the streets, apart from a few native homeless people and vagabonds who often had chosen this peculiar lifestyle. In Aarhus, you will probably encounter homeless people selling the magazine Hus Forbi (''House Passed''). More rarely, you could perhaps also meet a few vagabonds in the summertime; easily noticeable by their clothing, pushing along a baby carriage with their dog and friends on the side. Both groups are usually harmless and do not beg aggressively. You could even have some small-talk with most of them. Since the 2000's however, Denmark has experienced an influx of foreign beggars to the larger cities. This phenomenon does not come near the levels you might encounter outside of Scandinavia. You will perhaps bump into some of these illegal immigrants on your way around the city, and they can sometimes behave quite annoying. Be aware though, that begging is illegal in Denmark and handing money to the first one you meet, will not make the next one hesitate.\
\
===Street salespeople===\
Foreign beggars, a possible minor nuisance, are largely overshadowed by the army of trained street salespeople, known locally as "facers", that can't be avoided in Aarhus. They are everywhere in the pedestrian zone. Their goal is to sell deals on utility bills, new mobile phone subscriptions, and just about everything you had no idea you needed. The facer-troops also include young people on persistent reconnaissance for potential subscribers to all kinds of humanitarian causes. They can be harder to dismiss, but remember that even if you sign up in support for some Amnesty International campaign, it won't stop the next facer trying to get your support for the exact same cause only 2 minutes later.\

==Go next==\
=== Close by ===\
* Aarhus is surrounded by beautiful beech forests; take a stroll or do some green exercise in the urban forest-park of Riis Skov just north of the city centre or the extensive Marselisborg Forests along the southern coast. Each of the four seasons has its own particular charms, but the leaf bursting beech trees in early May is something special. \
\
[[File:Marselisborg Dyrehave.jpg|thumb|''Dyrehaven'' in Marselisborg Forests. Aarhus has some nice woodlands, beaches and countryside within easy reach.]]\
:* In '''Riis Skov''' you can spice up the trip with some great dining at the romantic ''[http://www.casablancaaarhus.dk/sjette-frederiks-kro/ Sjette Frederiks Kro]''. In the summertime you can also buy ice creams, coffee or hot dogs at one of two forest kiosks and take a swim, play or soak up some sun at the public seabath of ''Den Permanente''. There are facilities here for some beach grilling also, just bring coal and food. If you would like to explore the city more, you should try to take a walk through the adjacent neighbourhood of ''Tr\'f8jborg''. It is officially part of the city centre, but Tr\'f8jborg has its own particular charm, a bit like a small town within the city.    \
\
:* In the larger '''Marselisborg Forests''' (''Marselisborgskovene'') there are several options. Try to pay a visit to the '''[https://www.aarhus.dk/da/borger/natur-og-miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/Friluftsliv/Marselisborg-Dyrehave.aspx deer park]''' (''Dyrehaven'') for example. It is best to visit in April-May or August. Bring some carrots or apples to feed the deers if you like. Outstanding dining at [http://frederikshoj.com/ Fredriksh\'f8j Kro], great dining at [http://www.varna.dk/ Varna Pal\'e6et], [http://www.thorsmoelle.dk/ Thors M\'f8lle] and [http://www.helnan.dk/marselis/restaurant-marselis Marselis Hotel - Aarhus (Helnan)]. All close to the deer park.\
\
::In the Marselisborg forests you can also hike/bike/drive or take a bus to '''Moesg\'e5rd''', a section of the forests further south. Here you can experience the marked history trail from the Moesgaard Museum right down to the sea, with reconstructed Stone Age, Iron Age and Viking houses and tombs, rune stones etc.. There is a good caf\'e9 at the museum itself, you can choose to have an excellent lunch or evening meal at [http://restaurantunico.dk/ Restaurant UNICO] at the golf course close to the museum, have a great lunch at the medieval ''[http://restaurantunico.dk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2&Itemid=103&menuParent=103 Skovm\'f8llen]'' restaurant in the forests, or you can bring your own food as many of the locals do when they picnic at the large grassy areas at the beach in the summer months.\
\
* As a coastal city, there are many beaches to walk around Aarhus, just remember to bring warm clothes from October through early April. East Jutland is known for some good surf, angling and sports fishing opportunities [http://www.angling-eastjutland.dk/] and you could use Aarhus as a base.\
\
*In the village of Lisbjerg just north of Aarhus, you can visit '''[http://www.park13.dk/park.aspx Den Japanske Have]''', an authentic Japanese Garden laid out in traditional chisen-kaiyu style designed for promenading. The garden - which has no entry fee - is rather large and varied at more than 10,000 m2, and there is a restaurant and caf\'e9 here to, known as '''Park13'''. The garden is open from 10-17 on the weekends and the restaurant is open for lunch from 11-16. In the winter months, until Easter, the garden and restaurant are both closed, but larger events such as concerts are occasionally arranged here at that time. It takes 10-15 minutes to drive to the Japanese Garden by car from the city centre of Aarhus. Several bus lines also connects from the central bus station or you could take the trip on a bicycle; a bike path leads all the way along Randersvej.\
\
=== Day trips and further travels ===\
[[File:Rosenholm sydost.jpg|thumb|Rosenholm Castle. There are several interesting historic manors in the countryside around Aarhus.]]\
* There are a number of beautiful '''castles and manor houses''' located a short car ride (30 minutes to an hour) away from Aarhus. Options include Moesg\'e5rd Manor, Vilhelmsborg, Rosenholm Slot, Frijsenborg Slot and Gammel Estrup. Moesg\'e5rd Manor is located next to the new Moesg\'e5rd Museum, but only the outside grounds and the manor park is accessible. Vilhelmsborg (3km southwest of Moesg\'e5rd Manor) has a very good restaurant and a nice park and forest, a riding college and hosts a large amateur theatre play once in the summer. [http://www.gammelestrup.dk/ Gammel Estrup] 25km north of Aarhus and near Randers, is a museum and perhaps the best choice for event seekers. Here you can experience the inside of the manor first hand and several events are held throughout the year. [http://rosenholm.dk/ Rosenholm Slot] by Hornslet is a private residence, but offers occasional guided tours. Frijsenborg (at Hammel) is also a private residence, but situated in a beautiful forested countryside and close to [http://poetmoelle.dk/ P\'f8t M\'f8lle], an excellent restaurant and inn in an old timber framed milling house.\
\
* '''[http://djurssommerland.dk/ Djurs Sommerland]''', amusement park has Denmark's largest rollercoaster. Can be reached with buses 121, 122 and 123 in 1h15. Discount if buying your entrance ticket in the bus (you only pay DKK20 extra for the bus trip there and back).\
\
* Several '''nearby cities''' can be done in a day trip, with Aarhus as a base. Cities that might interest a traveller, includes [[Randers]], [[Gren\'e5]], [[Silkeborg]], [[Skanderborg]], [[Horsens]], [[Vejle]] and [[Ebeltoft]]. If you plan your daytrip well and get up in the morning, you might even make interesting and eventful one-day outings to [[Viborg]], [[Aalborg]] or [[Odense]]. Copenhagen is a 3 hour train ride away, but a bit longer if you go by bus or car.\
\
* '''[[Ebeltoft]]''' is a quaint little town about an hour bus ride away. You can catch bus 123 with a day ticket costing DKK125 (you can use this to also get out to the airport if arriving/leaving the same day). It has one main cobblestone street lined with shops and cafes and you can visit the glass museum (it has a mirror room that you can walk in!) or the world's longest wooden ship. The actual bus ride there takes you through some lovely green hilly countryside too. Just make sure you get off at the station called Ebeltoft C rather than waiting till the end of the line which is the Ebeltoft bus station... unless you enjoy a bit of a walk which one could say is a nice way to view the residential streets one wouldn't normally have done! Ebeltoft has a ferry connection to Zealand.\
\
* Visit the '''Kal\'f8 castle ruins''' 20km north of Aarhus and breathe in some nature scenery from the hilltops of the new '''[http://nationalparkmolsbjerge.dk/ Mols Bjerge National Park]'''. This trip can be combined with some excellent dining at [http://www.molskroen.dk/ Molskroen] in the cosy rural village of Femm\'f8ller or perhaps a travel further east to Ebeltoft.\
\
* Drive south to the nearby village of Hou and take the 1 hour ferry to the island of '''[[Sams\'f8]]'''. Hou is well served by both buses and train too, or if you are fit you can bike there; it is a safe and pleasant trip in itself. You can spend the day doing Sams\'f8 and even stay overnight, as there are several excellent hotels and good opportunities for some quality dining on the island. If you are here for a day trip only, drive/bike to Nordby, Nordby Bakker and perhaps Stavns Fjord. From Sams\'f8 you can continue your trip to Zealand, so you don't have to backtrack.   \
\
* If you are in Scandinavia or Denmark for hiking, the long distance '''[http://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Dokumenter/Teknik-og-Miljoe/Natur-og-Miljoe/Ud-i-naturen/brochurer-og-foldere/Vandreruten-Aarhus-Silkeborg.ashx Aarhus-Silkeborg hiking trail]''' starts of from the city centre of Aarhus. from \'c5parken to be specific. The first part of the trail includes the ''Brabrandstien'' pathway along the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake and \'c5rslev Lake further west. It is a beautiful trail to walk, and leads to the historically interesting and scenic landscape known as ''S\'f8h\'f8jlandet'' (The Lake Highlands) near Silkeborg. The Mols Bjerge National Park close by on Djursland also invites for good hiking experiences.\
\
* '''The Maguerite Route'''. The national [http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/margueriteroute Maguerite Route] (''Margueritruten'') passes through or can be started off from Aarhus. It is a self-drive route marked out to highlight the most picturesque areas and sites in Denmark.\
